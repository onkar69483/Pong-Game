## About the Project

This Pong Game is a classic arcade game built using the Turtle library in Python. It offers a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages. The objective of the game is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to hit the ball towards your opponent's side.

## Gameplay

The game features a tennis-like gameplay where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen. A ball bounces back and forth between the paddles. Each time a player misses the ball, a block starts dropping from the top. If the ball hits the block, the ball's speed increases, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement.

## Controls

- Left Player: Use `w` and `s` keys to move the paddle up and down, respectively.
- Right Player: Use the top (`↑`) and down (`↓`) arrow keys to move the paddle up and down, respectively.

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay with a twist.
- Increasing ball speed when hitting the dropping block.
- Simple and intuitive controls for a smooth gaming experience.
- Two-player mode for friendly competition.
- Colorful and engaging graphics.
